# manim-projects

This project contains the code used to generate the videos found on [my youtube channel!](https://www.youtube.com/c/VisualXAnimation)

Videos are generated using the library Manim. 

Since june 2021 i'm using the community version of Manim, also called Manim CE. Check out their [official documentation!](https://docs.manim.community/en/latest/#).
